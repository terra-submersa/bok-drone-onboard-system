# Junie guidelines 


# Code design
* use classes when you need to carry elements with 3 por more properties
* Target at not haviung functions longer than 12 lines of code (without comments an newlines). Breakout in smaller function or methods that can be individually tested and reused

## Testing
* your are using a TDD approach
* You are using pytest
* You are using unitest TestCase classes
* Use parameterized tests whenever relevant

## Additional information
* use pyproj for coordinatesystem transformations and such things
